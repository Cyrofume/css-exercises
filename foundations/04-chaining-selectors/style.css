/* Add CSS Styling */

.avatar.proportioned {
    height: auto;
    width: 300px;
}

/* height will be dynaimc for prop  */

.avatar.distorted {
    height: 400px;
    width: 200px;
}

/* hardcode is 200, so height is double this value  */

/* do not forget the units (px)  */

/* note the orginal prop / orginial distorted look nice because they have no restriction 
 This also means page loading is caused by unbounded size (too large)  
 These chaining rules are seen by the first div (aka avatar class)*/
